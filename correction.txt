2. Scope of reproducibility
TPC model has much higher accuracy of length of stay prediction than a LSTM/transformer model trained on the eICU dataset.

MSLE vs MSE

3.1
"The task of the TPC model is to predict the length
of stay of a patient in the ICU at different time
points using the time series data such as heart-rate,
diagnosis data such as blood glucose and other
static features such as age and demographics."

Some of above are static feature instead of time series data. So some modification required.
