2) What is the general problem this work is trying to do?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is of great importance to be able to utilize Intensive Care Unit resource
 efficiently in hospitals.
 One of the central issues in efficient ICU resource allocation is to have
 more accurate knowledge of how long a patient will stay.
 Therefore, in this work, the authors propose an more accurate approach
 for length of stay prediction.

3) What is the new specific approach being taken in this work, and what
 is interesting or innovative about it, in your opinion? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors propose an approach, Temporal Pointwise Convolution(TPC) model,
 which combines Temporal Convolutional, Pointwise Convolutional and Skip
 Connections.
 It is interesting to learn from paper that achieve better performance than
 LSTM and Transformer models, which are two strong models we learnt for
 time series EHR data.

4) What are the specific hypotheses from the paper that you plan to verify
 in your reproduction study? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to verify that the proposed TPC model will achieve much better
 performance than the two strong baseline models, LSTM and Transformer models,
 given the same input data.

5) What are the additional ablations you plan to do, and why are they interestin
g? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The authors have already done thorough ablations to model architecture(Temporal
 Pointwise Convolution), which includes temporal convolution only, pointwise
 convolution only, no skip connections and so on.
 We plan to do the first three to verify the result against the report in
 the paper.
 Also temporal convolution and pointwise convolution are the major components
 for the network, we would like to know their relative importance to the
 TPC network.
 Skip connection is useful trick.
 We are also interested in its contribution to the network.
 We have not got any new additional ablations to the network.
 But when we work on the paper, we may come up some.

6) State how you are assured that you have access to the appropriate data.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper is using eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical
 Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV v0.4) database.
 Therefore, the data sets are available from PhysioNet.

7) Discuss the computational feasibility of your proposed work â€“ make an
 argument that the reproduction will be feasible.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author did not state the computation resource for the work.
 But we believe it is computational feasible by looking at the size of data
 sets used(eICU database comprises 200,859 patient unit encounters between
 2014 and 2015 and MIMIC-IV database contains 69,619 ICU stays between 2008
 and 2019).

8) State whether you will re-use existing code (and provide a link to that
 code base) or whether you will implement yourself.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to refactor the proposed model(TPC) code so that we will be able
 to learn better the ideas behind the work and gain deeper understanding.
 However, for baseline models, we consider re-use the existing code if needed.
 When time is allowed, we will also consider re-implement the proposed model(TPC
) code ourselves.
